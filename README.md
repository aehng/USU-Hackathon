# 🩺 VoiceHealth Tracker
> Hackathon — Friday 5:00pm → Saturday 1:00pm

Voice-activated health logging with automatic trigger detection and flare-up prediction. Speak your symptoms, skip the forms. The app finds patterns you'd never notice yourself.

## 👥 Team
| Person | Role |
|---|---|
| **Eli** | Frontend — Voice UI + Log Screen + Project Coordination |
| **Noah** | Backend — LLM Integration + API Routes |
| **Clayton** | Backend — Database Schema + Analysis Engine |
| **Max** | Frontend — Dashboard + Charts + History Page |

---

## 🏗️ Stack
| Layer | Tech | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite | Fast setup, works on any phone browser |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) | Same language as LLM work, auto-generates API docs |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 | Handles array types natively (symptom/trigger lists) |
| Voice | Web Speech API | Built into Chrome/Edge, zero setup, no API cost |
| LLM | OpenAI GPT-4o | Noah's call — structured JSON output mode is reliable |
| Runtime | Docker Compose | Everyone runs the same environment |

> ⚠️ **Web app, not Android.** A React app works on every phone browser and deploys in seconds. Building an APK in 20 hours is a trap.

> ⚠️ **Chrome or Edge only** for voice recording. Web Speech API does not work in Firefox.

## 🌐 VM Access
Update this once the VM is set up Friday:

| | |
|---|---|
| **VM IP** | `192.168.x.x` ← fill in when known |
| **Frontend** | `http://192.168.x.x:3000` |
| **Backend API** | `http://192.168.x.x:8000` |
| **API Docs** | `http://192.168.x.x:8000/docs` (auto-generated by FastAPI) |

SSH: `ssh youruser@192.168.x.x`

## 🏛️ Architecture

```
[User's Phone — Chrome Browser]
        |
   Speaks into mic → Web Speech API converts to text
        |
[React Frontend]
        |
        | POST /api/log  (sends raw transcript)
        ↓
[FastAPI Backend]
        |              |
        ↓              ↓
  [PostgreSQL]    [LLM Service]
    stores           extracts structured data:
    entries          symptoms, severity, triggers, mood
                     also generates follow-up questions (guided mode)
                     also turns Clayton's stats into plain-English insights
        |
        ↓
[Analysis Engine]
  queries DB, runs correlations, finds patterns
        |
        ↓
[Dashboard — React]
  shows insight cards, charts, trigger heatmap, predictions
```

## 🔀 How Development Works

Everyone codes on **their own laptop** in their own editor. The VM is just the shared server.

**Git is your sync mechanism. Docker is the runtime.**

```
Your Laptop (VSCode)
  → write code
  → git push to GitHub
  
VM
  → git pull from GitHub
  → docker compose up --build
  → app live at 192.168.x.x
```

**Frontend devs (Eli + Max):** Run Vite locally on your laptop, pointed at the VM's backend. You'll see changes instantly without touching the VM.

**Backend devs (Noah + Clayton):** Run FastAPI locally, pointed at the VM's Postgres. Or run everything on the VM via Docker.

**Pulling to the VM:** Manual every 20-30 minutes is fine. No need to over-engineer this.

---

## 🌿 Branch Strategy
| Branch | Owner |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable — what the VM runs |
| `eli/voice-ui` | Eli |
| `noah/llm-backend` | Noah |
| `clayton/db-analysis` | Clayton |
| `max/dashboard` | Max |

Merge to `main` when something works end-to-end. VM pulls from `main`.

## 📡 API Contract
These are the endpoints everyone depends on. Agree on these shapes early — don't change them without telling the team.

| Method | Route | Owner | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | Noah | Health check — VM is up |
| POST | `/api/log/quick` | Noah | Log entry immediately, no follow-up |
| POST | `/api/log/guided/start` | Noah | Returns follow-up questions based on transcript |
| POST | `/api/log/guided/finalize` | Noah | Submit all guided Q&A, write final entry |
| GET | `/api/insights/{user_id}` | Noah + Clayton | AI-generated insight cards |
| GET | `/api/entries/{user_id}` | Clayton | Paginated entry history |
| GET | `/api/stats/{user_id}` | Clayton | Raw correlation stats for charts |

---

## 📋 JSON Contract
**Noah and Clayton must agree on this by 7pm Friday.** This is the shape of a logged entry and the stats output that feeds the LLM insight prompt.

### Entry (what gets stored):
```
user_id, raw_transcript, symptoms (array), severity (1-10),
potential_triggers (array), mood, body_location (array),
time_context, notes, logged_at
```

### Stats output (Clayton → Noah's LLM prompt):
```
trigger_correlations: [ { symptom, trigger, score, sample_size } ]
temporal_patterns:    [ { symptom, peak_day, peak_time, frequency } ]
severity_trends:      [ { symptom, trend, slope, data_points } ]
total_entries, date_range_days
```

## ⏱️ Timeline
| Time | Target |
|---|---|
| **Fri 5:00pm** | Repo cloned, Docker running, everyone SSH'd in, first `docker compose up` succeeds |
| **Fri 6:00pm** | Each person's Phase 1 milestone done (see individual task files) |
| **Fri 7:00pm** | ⭐ **Integration checkpoint** — Noah + Clayton finalize JSON contract |
| **Fri 9:00pm** | Voice → backend → DB working end to end |
| **Fri 11:00pm** | Insights endpoint live, dashboard showing real data |
| **Sat 1:00am** | Full flow works. Sleep. |
| **Sat 8:00am** | Polish, fix bugs, run seed script for demo data |
| **Sat 11:00am** | Code freeze. Rehearse demo. |
| **Sat 1:00pm** | 🏁 Submit |

## 🌱 Demo Data Strategy
Real pattern detection needs weeks of data. You have hours. Clayton writes a **seed script** Friday night that populates 30 days of fake entries with obvious baked-in patterns (caffeine → headache, poor sleep → fatigue). This makes the dashboard look compelling for judges. Do not skip this.

---

## ⚠️ VMware Gotcha
Set the VM's network adapter to **Bridged** mode (not NAT). This gives the VM its own IP on the WiFi so phones can reach it. Run `ip addr` on the VM to find the IP — write it in this README immediately.

If the venue WiFi blocks device-to-device traffic (common at hackathons), bring a cheap travel router as backup.
